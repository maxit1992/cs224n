# CS224N Assignments

This repository contains my solutions for the **CS224N: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning** course from **Stanford University**. The course covers various aspects of NLP, including machine learning techniques, deep learning models, and their applications in NLP tasks.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into subfolders, each corresponding to a specific assignment from the course. Each folder contains the relevant code and documentation for that assignment.

## Assignment Details

- **Assignment 1: [Exploring Word Vectors]**
  - Basic concepts of word vectors including co-ocurrence matrix and GloVe word embeddings.
  - [Link](/assignment1).
  - [Assignment Notebook](/assignment1/exploring_word_vectors.ipynb).
  - [Assignment PDF](/assignment1/exploring_word_vectors.pdf).

- **Assignment 2: [Word2Vec and Dependency Parsing]**
  - Review of the maths behing Word2Vec and build of a neural dependency parser using PyTorch.
  - [Link](/assignment2/).
  - [Assignment details](/assignment2/a2.pdf).
  - [Source code](/assignment2/code/).
  - [Written solutions](/assignment2/deliverables/a2_written.pdf).
  
 - **Assignment 3: [Neural Machine Translation]**
  - Analysis of Neural Machine Translation systems and implementation using RNNs.
  - [Link](/assignment3/).
  - [Assignment details](/assignment3/a3.pdf).
  - [Source code](/assignment3/code/).
  - [Written solutions](/assignment3/deliverables/a3_written.pdf).

- **[Other assignmentes WIP]**

## Prerequisites
