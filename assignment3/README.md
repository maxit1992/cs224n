# Assignment 3

## Introduction

This assignment is split into two sections: Neural Machine Translation with RNNs and Analyzing NMT Systems. The first is primarily coding and implementation focused, whereas the second entirely consists of written, analysis questions.

## Deliverables
- Written answers to conceptual theoretical questions. [LaTeX](/a3_written/) / [PDF](/deliverables/a3_written.pdf)
- Code implementing a neural dependency parser. [Source code](/code/) / [ZIP](/deliverables/assignment3.zip)

## Requirements

To create a new environment for this assignment, run:

#### 1. Create an environment with dependencies specified in env-cpu.yml (note that this can take some time):
    
    conda env create -f env-cpu.yml

#### 2. Activate the new environment:
    
    conda activate cs224nâˆ’cpu
    
#### To deactivate an active environment, use
    
    conda deactivate

## Run

#### To train the neural machine translation, execute:

    ./run.bat
